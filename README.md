## What is this? (Intro & Features)

Welcome to the Xeno Mini CRM - a project so ‚Äúmini‚Äù it uses **Redis Streams, Google Gemini, and a drag-and-drop React flow editor** just to send you a coupon. This is a full-stack, AI-powered, scalable CRM platform built for the Xeno SDE Internship Assignment 2025. It‚Äôs got more features than your average startup‚Äôs Series A pitch:

- **Secure REST APIs** for customer/order ingestion (with pub-sub, async, and validation, because why not be fancy?)
- **AI-powered campaign builder**: Describe your business goal in English, get a full campaign flow (segments, messages, delays, tags, CTAs) in JSON and as a beautiful, editable flowchart.
- **Dynamic rule builder**: AND/OR logic, nested groups, and live audience preview - basically, the ‚ÄúExcel for Marketers‚Äù experience.
- **Batch, event-driven delivery**: Campaigns are delivered via a simulated vendor API with real-world success/failure rates, and all delivery logs are batch-processed for scale (no more N+1 queries, thank you very much).
- **Campaign history page**: Stats, summaries, and more - all in a timeline that‚Äôs easier to read than your LinkedIn DMs.
- **Google OAuth 2.0 authentication**: Only real humans (and Google bots) can create or view campaigns.
- **AI-powered campaign performance summaries**: ‚ÄúYour campaign reached 1,284 users. 1,140 messages delivered. Customers with > ‚Çπ10K spend had a 95% delivery rate.‚Äù (Yes, AI wrote that for you.)
- **Modern, creative UI**: color-coded nodes, and enough Tailwind utility classes to make your laptop sweat.

## Architecture Diagram


![xeno-mini-crm-architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e8023c7-a237-4ad9-be56-141e24ee93f0)
On Excalidraw: https://excalidraw.com/#json=JFqwqNM3D76o5RTsT6Upz,x4IF1CWZy8sNreJCqEqUpQ


**Components:**
- **Frontend (React):** Campaign builder, history, auth, flow editor, AI integration
- **Backend (Node.js/Express):** REST APIs, pub-sub, batch consumers, AI endpoints, auth middleware
- **Redis Streams:** Pub-sub for ingestion & delivery, batch processing
- **MongoDB:** Stores customers, orders, segments, campaigns, logs
- **Google Gemini API:** Campaign flow and summary generation
- **Google OAuth:** Auth for all the things

---

## AI Tools & APIs Used

- **Google Gemini API**  
  - Used for: Natural language ‚Üí campaign flow, campaign performance summarization, smart tags/CTAs
  - Why: Fast, affordable, and less likely to hallucinate than your average LLM
- **@react-oauth/google**  
  - Used for: Frontend Google login
- **google-auth-library**  
  - Used for: Backend token verification (no imposters allowed)

---


## Known Limitations & Trade-Offs

- **No real SMS/email delivery**: The vendor API is as real as my gym membership (i.e., simulated).
- **No rate limiting or billing**: If you spam the AI endpoints, you might run out of tokens (or money).
- **No granular RBAC**: If you‚Äôre logged in, you‚Äôre an admin. (Hey, it‚Äôs a demo!)
- **No Kafka/RabbitMQ**: Redis Streams is plenty for this scale - but swap it out if you want to go full enterprise.
- **No mobile app**: But the UI is so responsive, you‚Äôll think it‚Äôs Flutter.
- **No GDPR compliance**: Please don‚Äôt use this in production unless you like legal drama.

---

## Bonus Features

- **Batch, event-driven delivery & logging**: Scalable, async, and as close to real-world as you‚Äôll get in a take-home.
- **AI-powered campaign summaries**: ‚ÄúYour campaign reached 1,284 users. 1,140 messages delivered. Customers with > ‚Çπ10K spend had a 95% delivery rate.‚Äù (AI wrote this so you don‚Äôt have to.)
- **Live audience preview**: No more ‚Äúsend and pray‚Äù - see your segment size in real time.
- **Smart tagging & scheduling**: AI can suggest campaign tags and send times (or at least pretend to).
- **Extensible architecture**: Want to add more AI, more channels, or more snark? Fork away.

## The End (or is it?)
